          MESSAGE: |
            This smoke test is here to check that the CSS file name does not change from the version we're currently using in production.

            Deploying a change to the CSS would currently cause 404s on the CSS during the rolling deployment to production. This would cause users to see an unstyled version of the form.

            See this trello card for more details - https://trello.com/c/cfGnjdZV/175-fix-issues-with-assets-404ing-during-rolling-deployments

            If you urgently need to deploy a CSS change, and you can accept a few minutes of unstyled pages being served to users, you can disable this task with /fly set-pipeline/
